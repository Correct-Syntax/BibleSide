        "ip": "The main reason for Paul's writing this letter was because he wanted to thank the believers there in Philippi for the gift that they had sent to help him in prison. His second reason for writing was so that he could encourage them and strengthen their faith despite difficulties that they would face, as well as his own difficulties. Paul advised them that they need to humble themselves like Yeshua had humbled himself when he was here on the earth. He reminds them again about the goodness and mercy of God, and how their faith in Messiah saves them. It's no longer necessary for them to be constrained by the Law of Moses and human beliefs. Then he wrote about the peace and happiness that God gives to those united in Messiah."
