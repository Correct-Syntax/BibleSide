Yohan's main purpose for writing this was to give hope to the believers and to encourage them to persevere in their faith despite their persecution."

At the time of writing, some were likely understood by the Christians of the time, but now, some of the symbols are very hard to interpret, and there's been a large range of interpretations from different people. But even though it's like that, there are also some signs that are easier to understand like ‘horns’ which denote power and authority, and ‘sword’ which denotes war. The themes are repeated throughout this document in various different forms. But it's important to just understand the main points of what's written here: God will indeed destroy all of his enemies through the messiah Yeshua, and also, he will reward all his people who persevere in serving him, and then he'll bring them to live with him. The final major them concerns the new sky and earth that God will create, and concerning the new Yerusalem that will descend from heaven."
