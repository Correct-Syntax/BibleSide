This document explains how David dealth with his enemies within the country, as well as battling with other nations in order to widen and strengthen his kingdom. David's faith and respect of God is demonstrated here, as well as his love for the people. However, despite that, he was also fierce and he was quite capable of disobeying God to get what he wanted. But God sees everything and seen his prophet Natan (Nathan) with a parable to show David his selfishness. David asked for forgiven for his sin and accepted the punishment that God gave him."
