They taught that if a person wants to be saved and wants to deepen their faith in God, it's not sufficient to have faith in the messiah because they said that it's necessary to obey other restrictions and customs as well as worshipping angels."

He told them that it's Yeshua who made everything around us, therefore he's greater than the angels and other unseen powers. He also saw the godliness of his father, and there's no other source of life for believers other than him. So then it's necessary that the believers don't follow human customs and traditions, but rather, it's necessary that they simply follow the messiah."
