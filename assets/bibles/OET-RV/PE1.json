Peter wrote to encourage the believers that it's necessary for them to be strong even in the middle of much persecution that comes because of their faith in the messiah. He reminds them about their salvation, the death of Yeshua the messiah, and of his coming back to life. Because Peter told them that there must always remember their hope in heaven, then they can persevere even through all the difficulties here on earth. He also reminds them that if their faith holds strong through their suffering of difficulties and persecutions, they will receive a gift at “The time when Yeshua the messiah is revealed.” (1:7,13)"
