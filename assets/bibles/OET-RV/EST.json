These events happened back when King Ahasuerus (more widely known as King Xerxes) ruled over the kingdom of Persia. After Queen Vashti was banished for refusing to dance in front the king's guests at a drinking party, Esther was chosen as the new queen without revealing her Jewish background. But there was a high official called Haman who was offended by Esther's Jewish guardian and in his anger, determined to annihilate all of the Jews from the kingdom. This account reveals how Ether's courage and her love for her Jewish people leads her to help them and eventually helps to save their lives."
