Both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Yeshua that he selected as his apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of the twelve, Yohan was the one that greatly loved Yeshua, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Yeshua's actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and all three of them worked on Lake Galilee as fishermen."
