We can see that especially in 10:45: “Even humanity's child didn't come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Yeshua did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Yeshua by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons."
