Some think this might be referring to a group of believers (in which case, the ‘chosen sister’ of the closing sentence might also be a congregation). This short letter reminds the recipients that it's necessary to keep following the truth of Yeshua's original teaching and to love each other. It also warns about those who teach that Yeshua was not the messiah (or was not God)."
