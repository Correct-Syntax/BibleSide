It was written around 500 B.C. once the replacement temple was finished in Yerusalem (Jerusalem). The main purpose of the messages is to encourage the priests and the people to turn back to God and obey him from their hearts. It's apparent that many of them were no longer obeying and worshipping God. The priests and the people were short-changing God by offering second-class animals for the sacrifices and none of them were following God's desires. But God intervened in order to judge and restore his people, and he will send a teacher to precede him to prepare the path and to restore his agreement."
