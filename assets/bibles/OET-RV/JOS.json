Yehoshua led them forward now after replacing Mosheh (Moses) when he passed away somewhere on a mountain. Some of the main events described in this document include: their crossing the Yordan river, the demolition of Yericho (traditionally ‘Jericho’), the war at Ay, the allocation of blocks of land to the various Israeli tribes and others, and the renewal of the agreement between God and his people."
