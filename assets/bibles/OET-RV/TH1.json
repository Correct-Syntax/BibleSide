Paul taught God's message there in Thessalonica after he left Philippi (Acts 17:1-4). Before long, there was disagreement from Jews upset about Paul's preaching to non-Jews (Acts 17:5-9). So Paul was forced to leave Thessalonica and he went on to Berea (Acts 17:10-13). Then after a while he went on to Athens (Acts 17:14-15). Finally, he continued on to Corinth (Acts 18:1-17). On his arrival there, he heard Timothy's account of his other work. He had been told by Timothy about the what the group of believers there in Thessalonica had been facing."

He answered questions again from the believers concerning the return of the messiah, and if the deceased believers would come back to life before the messiah returns. Paul used this letter to tell them it's necessary that they continue to work in their day-to-day jobs while they wait for the return of the messiah."
