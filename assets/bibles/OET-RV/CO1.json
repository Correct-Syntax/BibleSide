He wrote this in order to help with problems experienced by various groups of believers that he founded there in Corinth. Corinth was the mother city of province of Achaia and Achaia was a province of Rome. At that time, Corinth was a large city that Greeks, Romans, and Jews all lived in, and because it was at the edge of the ocean, many buyers and sellers travelled there to board ships. So the city became famous because of its wealth, and many religions thrived there. There was also a lot of sexual immorality there as well as other ancient traditions. Paul lived there for almost two years in order to preach, and many people believed (Acts 18)."

In this letter, he advised them about those, and stressed to need to removal sexual offenders from their assembly. Then he answered questions concerning marriage, widows, spiritual gifts, and the dead coming back to life."
