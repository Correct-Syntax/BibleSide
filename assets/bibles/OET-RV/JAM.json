This translation error can be traced all the way back to Yohan Wycliffe's English translation from the Latin in the 1300's as he didn't have access to Greek New Testament manuscripts (although he did use Yacob in some parts of his New Testament when it referred to the son of Isaac). The confusion was probably due to changes in the way Latin was spoken over the centuries, and then translating the name from the historically-altered Latin instead of from the original Greek—see https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/james-or-Yacob-in-the-bible for more details."
