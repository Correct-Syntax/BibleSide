These events happened around 520 B.C., after many of God's people had gone back to Yerushalem after being taken into captivity in Babylon. However, even though they'd been back for a considerable time, they hadn't worked on rebuilding the temple. Therefore, these messages from Yahweh encourage the people to change their priorities and obey God and rebuild the temple. God then promised to prosper the people and bless their living situation."
