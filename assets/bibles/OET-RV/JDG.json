Instead it's traditionally named ‘Judges’ in English because of around twenty uses of the Hebrew root ‘שָׁפַט’ (shafat) often in roots normally translated as ‘judged’. Despite that, there's not a single account in this document of these leaders judging the cases and conflicts of the common people. This dilemma offers two possible interpretations: 1/ that these leaders (often military leaders) did judge cases for the common people, but those details aren't recorded, or 2/ (which we've leaned more towards) that this Hebrew word has a wider range of meaning, and so we've leaned towards the English word ‘guided’ or ‘led’ in these contexts."
